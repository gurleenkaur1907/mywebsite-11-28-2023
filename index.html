									<h2><a href="#"> This is Gurleen Kaur </a></h2>
									<p>I am a diligent and motivated computer science student, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at Western Washington University. With a deep passion for technology and a drive to innovate, I am committed to expanding my knowledge and practical experience in the field of computer science.<br />
									Throughout my academic journey, I have been actively involved in coursework that has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, software development, algorithms, and data structures. I have also actively sought opportunities to apply my skills through internships, personal projects, and participation in coding competitions. These experiences have not only deepened my technical expertise but have also fostered my ability to collaborate effectively within multidisciplinary teams. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, software engineering and I am eager to contribute to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of what is possible in these areas. My ultimate goal is to leverage my education and passion for technology to make a positive impact in the world through innovative solutions and advancements in the field. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges and am actively seeking opportunities to further develop my abilities in a professional setting<br />
