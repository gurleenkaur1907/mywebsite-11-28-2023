								<h1>Analysis of security and privacy needs of hosts and guests in Airbnb ecosystem</h1>
								<p>Over time I have noticed that the concern with security and privacy has increased. It has always been a concern but as technology begins furthers its evolution more and more individuals are concerned that their privacy is more vulnerable. I began thinking about this problem when I visited Seattle with my sister and we stayed in an Airbnb. It got me thinking about how we put a lot of trust into airbnb’s and hotels when it comes to our security and privacy. We can be very vulnerable because it is a place that we trust to sleep at and we leave our belongings. This can affect a variety of groups of people from individuals on business trips to families on vacations. This doesn’t necessarily mean there are cameras in every place we stay, although there have been some cases. Most recently, according to an article written by Helen Coffey with Independence, a newly-wed couple allegedly found a hidden camera in their room. This recently happened in October 2023. As more of these stories arise, the number of people that are concerned with this issue increases. This doesn't just include just hidden cameras. If a place you are staying at offers a device for you to use, they could have software that could steal your info if individuals aren’t careful. There are more tactics that are used that can violate one's privacy.
									As we can see, over the years Airbnb has grown rapidly popular. With this popularity, many individuals would agree that there is an urgency when it comes to analyzing the unique security and privacy requirements faced by hosts and guests.There are studies aimed to investigate the current challenges in security and privacy for both parties within the economic system. Furthermore, it seeks to evaluate existing platform measures, identify gaps and vulnerabilities, and propose innovative strategies and technological solutions that can enhance the security and privacy experience for all the stakeholders involved.<p>
